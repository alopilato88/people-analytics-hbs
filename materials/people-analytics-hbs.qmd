## What is People Analytics?

Anyone have their own definition? Art? 

## People Analytics == Workforce Analytics?

>Workforce analytics is the discovery, interpretation, and communication of meaningful patterns in workforce-related data to inform decision making and improve performance.^[Guenole, N., Ferrar, J., & Feinzig, S. (2017). The power of people: Learn how successful organizations use workforce analytics to improve business performance. Pearson Education, Inc.]

## People Analytics and Measurement at McKinsey 

* We are a multi-team system grouped into functional pods: 
  + BI Personnel Pod
  + BI Recruiting Pod
  + Data Engineering Pod
  + Data Science Pod [Alex's Pod]
  + Dev & ML Ops Pod
  + Translator Pod [Art's Pod]

## Common Components of a People Analytics Group

* People Data Team (DE Pod for PAM)
* PA Products Team (Dev Pod for PAM)
* PA Insights Team (Translator Pod for PAM)
* Advanced Analytics & Data Science (Data science & ML Pods for PAM)^[Garbis, N. (2022). Blueprint for building a people analytics team [White paper]. One Model. https://www.onemodel.co/whitepapers/blueprint-pa-team]

## Data Science + People Analytics = Behavioral Data Science

>Behavioral Data Science is a new, emerging, interdisciplinary field, which combines techniques from the behavioral sciences, such as psychology, economics, sociology, and business, with computational approaches from computer science, statistics, data-centric engineering, information systems research and mathematics, all in order to better model, understand and predict behavior.^[Pogrebna, G. (2020). What is behavioral data science and how to get into it. *Medium*. https://medium.com/behavior-design-hub/what-is-behavioral-data-science-and-how-to-get-into-it-e389ed20751f]

## Three Important Behavioral Data Science Topics

It's important to consider the following three (broad) topics whenever you start a new project: 

* The importance of measurement. 
* The limits of statistical models and the role of theory. 
* The importance of ethical AI (ethical risk mitigation).

## Use Case 1: Selection System Development

You're a manager of a People Analytics team at a large software engineering firm and your team has been tasked with overhauling the systems in place to select their entry-level software engineer role. You've been given the following three goals: 

1. Hire employees who will be top performers
2. Increase the diversity of the organization's hires
3. Reduce selection costs

## Use Case 2: Retention Analytics

Your team has been tasked with understanding why the organization is experiencing such high turnover among its entry-level software engineers. You've been given the following goals: 

1. Discover the factors driving entry-level software engineer attrition
2. Provide recommendations for interventions to improve retention
3. Estimate the financial impact of attrition
